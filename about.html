        <h4>
            tomorrow soup is an artistic collaboration consisting of <a href="https://www.rayamward.com">Raya Ward</a> and <a href="http://www.kylebarn.es">Kyle Barnes</a>, two young humans meandering and making at the intersections of technology, ecology and society.
        </h4>
        <p>
            tomorrow soup‘s work explores concepts such as play, climate consciousness, speculative futures, privacy/surveillance/data, ecology, justice, and tech ethics. They take inspiration from ecofeminist methodologies, speculative design practices, and critical HCI lenses. The duo’s work takes many forms including new media art, community events, web installations, writing, and graphic design.
