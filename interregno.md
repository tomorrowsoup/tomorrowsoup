there is a restlessness to the present. from the present, we look back. in memory and in resistance, we are pruning — cutting back, attempting to undo a history that is already embodied. the toxins are inside us too. experiencing the imbalance, we renavigate the malnourished and abused soil we find ourselves knotted in, bending and stretching our roots in new directions. there is a reaching back toward history, a retracing that reveals new paths. at the same time, we also are dreaming forward: exchanging nutrients amongst kin as we prepare to bloom into futures of unrealized new dimensions. seeding visions of un-captured connection. 

this moment — this in-between — comes with a weight: to experience its breadth is to bear its grief. and yes, the moment, via comparison, is also incomprehensibly small: just a point, a single boop! there in the middle, constantly incrementing forward as the past continues to consume. 

what can we do here?
balancing on this precarious point between the vast planes of pasts and futures, we open an invitation.

tomorrow soup invites you to interregno: a gathering, a memorial — an anti-monument — to climate grief. In our shared in-between, we, Victor Guerra, Linn Phyllis Seeger, Marcos Martins, and Gasper Cohen offer you a portal into the hidden spaces of the surround. in this happening of guided grief meditation, nurtured ambience and collaborative performance, we welcome acknowledge the ongoing wake with an evening of ritual, reflection, and play.
