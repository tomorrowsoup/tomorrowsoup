            A zine, series of essays, and card deck augmenting the work of the #NoTechForApartheid campaign to inform and challenge students and future tech workers to refuse providing their labor to tech companies until they cut unethical contracts with the IDF, created in collaboration with colleagues Amber Rahman and Dan Wey.

            Centering the need for collective change, this digital zine collection serves as a toolkit to unveil Amazon and Google’s complicity in global systems of oppression, particularly in Israeli apartheid. The first section engages in collective political education, disrupting ways of knowing about technology development and laying out how Amazon and Google’s contract with the Israeli government, called Project Nimbus, expands apartheid against Palestinians. The second, troubling “impact-speak” reimagines how we think and speak about the outcomes of tech companies and their technologies. The third, within the system, asks how we might articulate values and organize beyond internal feedback structures to make change within tech companies. The fourth, Who Should Refuse? explores the politics and ethics of working for big tech by researching why students are drawn to work for these companies in the first place and beginning to present alternatives.         </p>

            This resource also contains a digital card deck of questions for having tough conversations about the ethics of working in tech, designed to facilitate campus discourse about the ethical pitfalls of providing labor to tech companies building products for militarism, apartheid, surveillance, and policing. We additionally created a LinkedIn page for tech workers to indicate publicly their refusal of labor. This project was done in collaboration with Amber Rahman and Dan Wey.
